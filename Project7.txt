Consider the following database
Project(project_id,proj_name,chief_arch) , project_id is primary key
Employee(Emp_id,Emp_name) , Emp_id is primary key
Assigned-To(Project_id,Emp_id)
Find the SQL queries for the following:
1. Get the details of employees working on project C353
2. Get employee number of employees working on project C353
3. Obtain details of employees working on Database project
4. Get details of employees working on both C353 and C354
5. Get employee numbers of employees who do not work on project C453

-- Create the Project table
CREATE TABLE Project (
    project_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    proj_name VARCHAR(255),
    chief_arch INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (chief_arch) REFERENCES Employee(Emp_id)
);

-- Create the Employee table
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    Emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Emp_name VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Create the Assigned-To table
CREATE TABLE Assigned_To (
    project_id INT,
    Emp_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES Project(project_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (Emp_id) REFERENCES Employee(Emp_id)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO Project (project_id, proj_name, chief_arch)

    (1, 'C353', 101),

INSERT INTO Assigned_To (project_id, Emp_id)
VALUES 
    (1, 101),

    (3, 103);

-- Queries
-- 1. Get the details of employees working on project C353
SELECT e.Emp_id, e.Emp_name
